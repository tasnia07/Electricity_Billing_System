CSE470- Software Engineering Project with MVC Pattern:

The purpose of this projectÂ was to teach us how to apply the MVC pattern and conduct unit testing; this project was inspired by the YouTube channel "Code for Interview."

This is a five-person group project. Each member was required to choose a separate topic but could implement it using similar programming languages and features.
